== Jakarta EE 10 Second Level Cache Demo

This example shows how to build and test a REST Application using Second Level Cache Demo with Jakarta EE 10

In order to test the application you can use the following sample REST script:

----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/2lcache-demo/rest/customers  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"frank","surname":"marchioni"}'

curl http://localhost:8080/2lcache-demo/rest/customers

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/2lcache-demo/rest/customers?id=3

curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/2lcache-demo/rest/customers  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":"1", "name":"frank","surname":"marchioni"}'
----

If you are using Postman for your tests, within the `Postman` folder there's a Collection script to test the application from Postman.
